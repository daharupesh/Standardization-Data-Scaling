# Standardization in Data Scaling

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of **standardization** in data scaling using the machine learning model `StandardScaler`. The aim is to investigate the effects of standardization on a dataset and to visualize the differences in model performance before and after standardization.

## Introduction

Standardization is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning that transforms features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This project explores its significance and demonstrates how it impacts model performance.

## Why Standardization?

1. **Improves Model Performance:** Many algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the features. Standardization ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations.
2. **Accelerates Convergence:** Gradient descent methods converge faster with standardized data.
3. **Facilitates Comparisons:** Makes it easier to compare results across different models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features that require standardization. Specific details about the dataset, including its origin and structure, can be added here.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Standardization:**
   - Apply `StandardScaler` to the dataset.
   - Compare the scores of a machine learning model on the original and standardized datasets.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the model before and after standardization using appropriate metrics.

## Results

The results show a significant difference in model performance before and after standardization. Experimentation revealed improved scores on the standardized dataset.

### Performance Scores

- **Original Dataset Score:** [60%]
- **Standardized Dataset Score:** [80%]
